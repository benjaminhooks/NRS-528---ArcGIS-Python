## **About Ben**


My name is Ben Hooks, one of the new MESM students joining this semester. I'm originally from Rhode Island and...still in Rhode Island! Cabin fever has started to set in a bit during COVID, but my fondness for RI is still going strong. I graduated earlier this year from URI with a B.S. in Marine Biology and became highly interested in the MESM program during this past year. Lots of time was spent hiking trying to decide what the next step would be (for those white mountain enthusiasts, we should have a MESM hiking trip when it's safe). I found I was lacking the technical skills necessary to succeed in my desired field, so I enrolled and am now pursuing my master's degree in Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis with a certificate in Natural Resources and the Environment. After completing these programs, my goal is to have the required expertise to aid in conservation efforts in a variety of settings utilizing GIS technologies and the knowledge I gained from natural resource classes. 

I have a variety of interests to keep me sane, especially during this quarantine. Some of the **prominent** ones being;
* Hiking
* Camping
* Photography
* Riding my motorcycle
* Finding a cool new whiskey

I recently began a website for my photography, which you can find [here](www.benhooks.com). *Obviously* done in Squarespace, because I cannot code yet! Hopefully, I will learn skills throughout this class to aid in my future endeavors to create a website from scratch.
