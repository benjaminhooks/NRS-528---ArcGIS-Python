## **About Ben**


My name is Ben Hooks, a new MESM students joining this semester. I'm originally from Rhode Island and...still in Rhode Island! Cabin fever has started to set in a bit during COVID, but my fondness for RI is still going strong. I graduated earlier this year from URI with a B.S. in Marine Biology and became highly interested in the MESM program during this past year. Lots of time was spent hiking trying to decide what the next step would be. I found I was lacking the technical skills necessary to succeed in my desired field, so I enrolled and am now pursuing my master's degree in Remote Sensing and Spatial Analysis with a certificate in Natural Resources and the Environment. After completing these programs, my goal is to have the required expertise to aid in conservation efforts in a variety of settings (hopefully coastal based environments) utilizing GIS technologies, and the knowledge I gain from the natural resource classes. 

I have a variety of interests to keep me sane, especially during this quarantine. Some of the **prominent** ones being;
* Hiking :hiking_boot:
* Camping :tent:
* Photography :camera_flash:
* Riding my motorcycle :motorcycle:
* Finding a cool new whiskey :tumbler_glass:

I recently began a website for my photography, which you can find [here](http://benhooks.com). Most definitely done in Squarespace, because I cannot code yet! Hopefully, I will learn skills throughout this class to aid in my future endeavors to create a website from scratch so I dont have to rely on everyones favorite youtube sponsor. 

One of my favorite pictures was taken on a camping trip this summer. My landscapes often have mountains as their primary focus, so taking a picture of a lone tree was a nice change of pace.

This will be the first coding class I have ever taken, and subsequently the first time I have "programmed". I'm sure I will struggle at times, but I am excited to learn a new skill that has such a huge potential to aid me in my life and career. 

For the sake of practice, here is a table of the classes I will be taking this semester
